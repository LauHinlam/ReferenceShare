In a teamwork, it can be used to share referances on the internet with other members. It works on BAE(Baidu App Engine).

index.htm is to share. Two input boxes are included, one is to take the link of referance and the other is title. Click "Submit" button and these two will be inserted into database(MySQL in this case). Alert box will pop up to show status, and then page will skip to index.htm again.

link.php will fetch data from database and show it. In addition, sequence number and hyperlink will be added for each item.
